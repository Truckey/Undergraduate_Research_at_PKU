# EEG Data Processing Practice

In March 2019, I implemented a **inverted decoding model** (Brouwer & Heeger, 2009) based on the EEG data collected from a visual working memory task (conducted by Qiaoli Huang, gruduate student in Huan's Lab). I successfully decoded the orientation of the stimuli and replicated Huang's result.

Never before have I practiced **Matlab programming**, nor **EEG data processing**. Therefore, I learned some basic knowledge by myself, and carefully read the tutorial provided by Tommy Sprague on Github (https://github.com/tommysprague/IEM-tutorial). I learned a lot about Matlab and EEG data analysis during the process.

Here I provide the code and sample output of my program. Since the data has not been published yet, I didn't upload it.
