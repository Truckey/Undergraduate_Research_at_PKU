# Auditory Working Memory Experiment Design



## Participants

- no limit on musical training
- no limit on handedness (but probably needing to analyze seperately)



## Stimuli

- two musical sequence seperated by 2000-ms silence

- each sequence containing three 250-ms piano tones (C4 to E6 (except for S2 of condition TRANSPOSITION, which may be as high as E7), 70 dB SPL, presented binaurally through air-conducting tubes with foam ear tips) presented successively without inter-tone-interval

- S1: 108 musical sequences generated by [Sibelius](http://www.sibelius.com) (probably we'll use another way)

  - tonal
  - no consecutive identical tones within a sequence
  - pitch interval between consecutive tones inferior to an octave

- S2: for the incorrect trials in condition SIMPLE, REVERSED and TRANSPOSITION:

  - one tone (at any position) changed for 2/3 semitones
  - maintaining the contour (the relative magnitude of three tones)

  for condition CONTOUR:

  - correct trials: modifying one tone of S1 by 2/3 semitones but maintaining the contour
  - incorrect trials: modifying one tone of S1 so as to change the contour (currently done by raising the 3rd tone to a pitch 2/3 semitones higher than the 1st, or lowering the 1st to that lower than the 3rd)
  



## Procedure

- Presentation software: [Neurobehavioral Systems](https://www.neurobs.com/presentation) (probably replaced by *Psychtoolbox*)
- Recording: 62 channels + EOG + nose reference + ground
- Trial pipeline:
  - No cue for trial beginning
  - Visual: fixating a continuously displayed cross (white on a gray background)
  - 750-ms S1
  - 2000-ms retention
  - 750-ms S2
  - 2000-ms reaction (pressing one of two buttons with right hand, no feedback)
  - 500-ms - 1000-ms randomized ITI (in order to remove the effect of expectation)
- Conditions:
  - SIMPLE: simple comparison
  - REVERSED: requiring subjects to mentally reverse S1 during retention, then compare it with S2
  - TRANSPOSITION: requiring subjects to mentally raise S1 for an octave during retention, then compare it with S2
  - CONTOUR: requiring subjects to mentally change the movement S1 into categories ("up-up" / "up-down" / "down-up" / "down-down") during retention, and that of S2 during reaction, then compare them

- Design:
  - block design
    - 2 blocks for each condition (totally 8 rather than the original 4), latin-square arrangement
    - 2-3 minutes rest between two blocks
    - each block containing 27 correct trials and 27 incorrect (totally 54 rather than the original 108), no consecutive three trials with the same response
    - totally 108 trials (rather than 216) for each condition
  - 4 * 27 practice trials (without feedback) at the very beginning, with sequences not used in formal experiments, 75% (can be a little lower considering the difficulty) accuracy required
- 10 practice trials or so before every block
  
- Total time estimation:
  - 6.25 * 84 / 60 = 8.75 min/block
  - approximately (8.75 + 2.25) * 8 = 88 min, 20% longer than the original study
